# Build your VR Resume

In this open-ended project, you'll be building your virtual reality resume - that is, a world that tells the user who you are, what your interests are, what your background is, and anything else you would put on a personal website. We don't have too many requirements here other than to make it YOURS!

## Instructions

Fork and clone this repository or start from scratch. If you're using a fork of this repository, we've already linked A-Frame for you.

## Ideas

+ Create a wall of your photos that you can walk up to. (Advanced: Add interactivity - when you click on a photo, have it expand.)

+ Add some [text components](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/primitives/a-text.html) to provide more information about yourself.

+ Try using [fancy fonts in A-Frame](https://github.com/etiennepinchon/aframe-fonts).

+ Try importing and placing objects of personal significance to you.

+ Add objects that you build using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). Download the .obj and .mtl files to integrate them onto your page.

+ Tell us about where you've traveled or would like to travel by adding pictures or objects (i.e. add in the Eiffel Tower if you'd like to go to Paris!).

+ Make it [rain stars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-particle-system-component).
