# Build your VR Resume

In this open-ended project, you'll be building your virtual reality resume - that is, a world that tells the user who you are, what your interests are, what your background is, and anything else you would put on a personal website. We don't have too many requirements here other than to make it YOURS!

## Instructions

Fork and clone this repository or start from scratch. If you're using a fork of this repository, we've already linked A-Frame for you.

## Ideas

+ Create a wall of your photos that you can walk up to. (Advanced: Add interactivity - when you click on a photo, have it expand.)

+ Add in clickable links or objects to your social media (Instagram, etc) using the [a-frame href component library](https://github.com/gasolin/aframe-href-component). You'll need to copy and paste the contents of index.js into your own JS file and link it on your index.html page.

+ Create text cards (Check out [this example](https://codepen.io/elliepooh/pen/xdQdpb)) with information about your previous work and education experiences.

+ Try importing and placing objects of personal significance to you.

+ Add objects that you build using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). Download the .obj and .mtl files to integrate them onto your page.

+ Tell us about where you've traveled or would like to travel by adding pictures or objects (i.e. add in the Eiffel Tower if you'd like to go to Paris!).
